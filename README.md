### Hi, I'm Scott

My strongest areas are collaboration, communication, and community engagement. It's fulfilling to help solve real-world problems using open-source tools and forward-thinking projects. I strive to lead by example, smooth the path for people to succeed as a team, and feel proud of our collective efforts.
